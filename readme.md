## Geographic Analysis

Performance varies significantly across Turkana's sub-counties:
- **Turkana Central and West**: Highest patient volumes and service delivery
- **Kibish and Turkana East**: Lower volumes but higher achievement rates in some indicators

## Program Strengths

1. **High Viral Suppression**: Consistently above 90% across all sub-counties
2. **Strong TB-HIV Integration**: High testing and treatment rates for TB-HIV co-infection
3. **Robust Treatment Retention**: Effective client tracking and return-to-care systems
4. **Key Population Services**: Leading prevention intervention at 58.46% achievement

## Areas Requiring Attention

1. **HIV Testing Services**: Overall testing needs acceleration to reach annual targets
2. **PMTCT Coverage**: Currently below 20% of annual targets
3. **PrEP New Enrollments**: Significant gap at 14.57% achievement
4. **Gender-Based Violence Services**: Requires strengthened implementation
5. **Cervical Cancer Screening**: Integration with HIV services needs enhancement

## Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Community Mobilization**: Increase HTS uptake through targeted outreach
2. **Enhance ANC Integration**: Improve PMTCT coverage through better ANC-HIV service integration
3. **PrEP Demand Creation**: Develop specific strategies to increase new PrEP enrollments
4. **GBV Service Strengthening**: Train more providers and improve reporting systems
5. **Sub-County Support**: Provide targeted technical assistance to lower-performing sub-counties
